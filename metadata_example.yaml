  # Optional ephys fields for non-default processing:
  plug_order: "chip_first" # "chip_first" or "cable_first". Defaults to "chip_first" if none specified
  min_impedance_ohms: 1e5 # Defaults to 1e5. Channels below this will be tagged as "bad channel"

  # If you have spike sorting data, specify the following ephys subfields:
  mountain_sort_output_file_path: "tests/test_data/processed_ephys/firings.mda"

notes:
  General notes about this session, if any.
  For example - Reward used was 15uL sucrose solution (10% sucrose, 0.1% NaCl) at each reward port. 
  The rat was water deprived before the experiment. 
  Animal weight was 478g before the session (89% of 537g baseline weight).
