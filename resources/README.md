# Hex Centroids
Much of our analysis relies on assigning a rat's x,y position to a corresponding hex in the maze.
The [Get_Hex_Centroids.ipynb](Get_Hex_Centroids.ipynb) notebook is used to create a csv file of centroids of each hex (in video pixel coordinates) given a video file of the maze. You may wish to create a new centroids file for each session, or use the same file across multiple sessions as long as the maze and camera do not move.

The `resources/frank_lab` folder contains some video files and associated hex coordinate files for different maze positions.

## Channel map
The `channel_map` csv has 256 entries, mapping each electrode to the intan channel it corresponds to.
The channel map for the probe electrodes depends on how the rat was plugged in.  

The `chip_first` column is the channel map for when the chip side (top in eagle) is plugged into first port (preferred). This is the assumed default unless otherwise specified. The `cable_first` column is the channel map for if the cable side (bottom in eagle) was plugged into first port. The cable_first map is simply the chip_first map shifted by Â±128, and vice versa (to go from one to the other, subtract 128 from values greater than 128, and add 128 to values less than or equal to 128).

#### ECoG channels
We currently do not use ECoG (electrocorticogram) channels for recordings in the hex maze. It is possible this may change in the future, in which case the ECoG channels will be as follows:
```
ecogs.cable=[64 0 191 255]+1; %cable first ecog intan channels / screw 1-4
ecogs.chip=[192 128 63 127]+1; %chip first ecog intan channels
```
If using ECoG, this is a useful check for how the rat was plugged in: If ECoG channel 1+4 connected and the plug sequence was "chip first", then channels 129 and 193 (one based) will be low impedance. If the plug sequence was "cable first", channels 65 and 256 will be low impedance.

## Electrode coordinates

The electrode coordinate files contain the relative electrode locations for each probe.
The 3mm and 6mm probes both have 32 shanks, 8 electrodes per shank, and 30um electrode pitch (30um vertically between electrodes on each shank). Odd shanks are vertically offset by 1/2 the electrode pitch (15um).
The 3mm probe has 66um shank pitch (66um horizontally between shanks).
The 6mm probe has 80um shank pitch (80um horizontally between shanks).


The electrode coordinate files originally had 264 entries each: 256 entries for the 256 electrodes + an extra 8 channels recorded by OpenEphys (ADC1 - ADC8). ADC1 records port entry times for alignment, ADC2-ADC8 are unused.
The x, y coordinates for these channels are assigned arbitrarily (they do not actually exist on the probes). They were likely included for alignment purposes in an earlier processing pipeline. I'm not sure if we need them for anything right now, so I have removed them from the csv files but pasted them here for posterity:

Extra 8 channels for 3mm probe:
2376,211
2376,181
2376,151
2376,121
2376,91
2376,61
2376,31
2376,1

Extra 8 channels for 6mm probe:
2880,211
2880,181
2880,151
2880,121
2880,91
2880,61
2880,31
2880,1

# Photometry resources
The `photometry_devices.yaml` file contains a running list of excitation sources (i.e. LEDs and their metadata/wavelengths), optic fibers, and photodetectors used by the Berke Lab for the hex maze task. Note that this list is currently in-progress and some values are placeholders. The ndx-fiber-photometry extension for nwb is still in development, so how we specify these values is subject to change.
