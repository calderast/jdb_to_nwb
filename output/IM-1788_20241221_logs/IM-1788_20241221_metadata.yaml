  # Berke Lab currently uses 2 possible probes for the hex maze task, specified below.
  # Un-comment the probe used for your experiment.
  # device:
  #   name: "256-ch Silicon Probe, 3mm length, 66um pitch"

surgery:
  maybe a slight leakage on the right hemisphere. Recording mostly done on the left hemisphere.

virus: 
  1:3 dilution is also used in Vijay Namboodiri's mouse surgery for dLight3.8 expression

notes:
  Reward used was 40uL sucrose solution (10% sucrose, 0.1% NaCl) at each reward port.
  The rat was water deprived before the experiment. 
  Behavior was great. The room has the dimmest ceiling light set.
