    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide the path to a Frank Lab nwbfile with statescriptlogs saved as AssociatedFiles objects and behavioral event DIOs in the behavior processing module.\n",

    "Specify save type: \"pickle\" or \"csv\" to save the trial and block dataframes for each epoch as .pkl or .csv files. Any other save_types will be ignored. Tomorrow I will fix the version where it saves the blocks as intervals directly in the nwbfile.\n",
