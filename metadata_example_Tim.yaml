surgery:
  Bilateral dLight 1.3b and optic fibers. Fiber implant was .2 mm above injection site (DV -6.0).
  Hippocampal implant was in the left hemisphere.
virus:
  AAVDJ-CAG-dLight1.3b (Vigene) at a titer of 2x10^12 at AP +1.7, ML +/-1.7, DV -6.2
notes:
  Reward used was 15uL sucrose solution (10% sucrose, 0.1% NaCl) at each reward port.
  The rat was water deprived before the experiment.
