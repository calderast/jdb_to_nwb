surgery:
  Surgery took place on 2025-05-03.
  Rat was bilaterally injected in the nucleus accumbens core with both ACh3.8 and rDA3m AAV virus. 
  Fibers were placed bilaterally, targeting the NAcc.
  No Complications

virus: 
  ACh3.8 and rDA3m AAV virus were injected bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens core on 2024-05-03.
  The titer for rDA3m was 5.89e12 vg/mL and ACh3.8 was 1.15e13 (BrainVTA). 
  The injection was done in a cocktail at a volume was 1.0 uL per hemisphere.

notes: 
  Reward used was 30uL sucrose solution (10% sucrose, 0.1% NaCl) at each reward port. 
  The rat was water deprived before the experiment.
